# hello-world
This is my christening Git repository. Let the games begin!

I am currently a software engineer, but I am having a change of heart career-wise. Well, it's more like a crisis.
I am undecided about where I am going, but I plan to get there pretty quickly.

I am seriously considering game design/game development.
