# hello-world
This is my christening Git repository. Let the games begin!

I am currently a software engineer, but I am having a change of heart career-wise. Well, it's more like a crisis.
I am gung-ho web developer, front-end specifially, because while I enjoy coding I prefer to be able explore my visual creativity as well.
